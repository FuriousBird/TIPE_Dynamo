# Pipeline Overview

The `pipeline` folder contains scripts designed to process and prepare data for analysis. Below is an overview of the files and their purposes:

## File Descriptions

1. **`conversion.py`**  
    Handles data conversion and normalization. Use this script to transform raw data into a standardized format suitable for further processing.

2. **`labeling.py`**  
    Facilitates manual labeling of data. After normalization, use this script to assign labels to the data as needed.

3. **`speed.py`**  
    Analyzes and processes speed-related data. Use this script to compute or manipulate speed metrics.

4. **`speed_dist.py`**  
    Focuses on speed distribution analysis. Use this script to calculate and visualize the distribution of speed data.

## Usage Workflow

1. **Data Conversion and Normalization**  
    Start with `conversion.py` to prepare your raw data.

2. **Manual Labeling**  
    Use `labeling.py` to label the normalized data.

3. **Speed Analysis**  
    Run `speed.py` and `speed_dist.py` for speed-related computations and visualizations.

Follow this sequence to ensure a smooth data processing pipeline.
